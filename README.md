# A library of formalised undecidable problems in Coq

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability)

This library contains undecidable problems and formalised reductions between them.
Feel free to contribute or start using the problems!

## Existing undecidable problems

- Satisfiability in Intuitionistic (Classical) First-Order Logic (`satis` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v), `ksatis` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v))
- Halting problem for FRACTRAN programs (`FRACTRAN_REG_HALTING` in [`Problems/FRACTRAN.v`](theories/Problems/FRACTRAN.v)), **`good seed`**
- Satisfiability for elementary diophantine constraints (`DIO_ELEM_SAT` 
  in [`Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v`](theories/Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v))
- [Hilbert's 10th problem](https://uds-psl.github.io/H10), i.e. solvability of a single diophantine equation (`H10` in 
  in [`Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v`](theories/Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v))
- Satisfiability of elementary Diophantine constraints of the form `x=1`, `x=y+z` or `x=y.z` without parameters (`H10C_SAT` in [`Problems/H10C.v`](theories/Problems/H10C.v)), **`good seed`**

## How to build

If you can use `opam 2` on your system, you can follow the instructions here.
If you cannot use `opam 2`, you can use the `noopam` branch of this repository, which has no dependencies, but less available problems.

### Required packages

You need `Coq 8.8.1`, `8.8.2` or `8.9.1` built on OCAML `> 4.02.3`, the [Equations](https://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/) package and the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/metacoq/) package for Coq. If you're using opam 2 you can use the following commands to install the dependencies on a new switch:

```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam switch create coq-library-undecidability 4.07.1+flambda
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install . --deps-only
```

### Build external libraries

The Undecidability libraries depends on several external libraries. Initialise and build them once as follows:

``` sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
make deps
```

### Building the undecidability library

- `make all` builds the library
- `make html` generates clickable coqdoc `.html` in the `website` subdirectory
- `make clean` removes all build files in `theories` and `.html` files in the `website` directory
- `make realclean` also removes all build files in the `external` directory. You have to run `make deps` again after this.
